### About me

I'm an engineer and entrepreneur committed to building beneficial tech for public good. I'm most passionate about and thus primarily build in the AI/ML and full-stack web development spaces. At the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI), I conduct research under postdoc Cam Allen in value alignment and bounded optimality in human-AI assistance games given resource asymmetry and constraints. For my talent and passion in technology, leadership, and public service, I've been awarded the full-ride Smart Nation Scholarship by GovTech Singapore for my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley.

Outside of tech, I love to play volleyball, boulder, and draw manga!
