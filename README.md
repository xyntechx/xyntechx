Hello! My name is Nyx!

I'm a teenager passionate about Computer Science and all things STEM! As a programmer, I aim to create fun via the code I write, which is translated into games, web apps, and other interesting projects. In doing so, I hope to teach and inspire those who aspire to pursue STEM in the future.
