I am Nyx Iskandar, a teenager passionate about Computer Science and all things STEM! As a programmer, I aim to create fun via the code I write, which is translated into games, web apps, and other interesting projects. In doing so, I hope to teach and inspire those who aspire to pursue STEM in the future.

## Goals
As I pursue my passion in programming, I look forward to learning many more concepts and techniques in the ever-growing field of Computer Science. Currently, I am learning Machine Learning and Quantum Computing because I am extremely intrigued by those fields! Furthermore, I hope to create more games and apps because, in all honesty, I thoroughly enjoy programming and designing as both allow me to express myself creatively in this thought-provoking field. Last but not least, I want to dive into competitive programming as I hope to polish up my problem solving and creative thinking skills. All in all, I aim to learn something new every single day!
