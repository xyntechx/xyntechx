Hi there 👋 My name is Nyx (a.k.a. [xyntechx](https://xyntechx.com))

I've always loved making stuff, from manga to password-locked pencil cases. In late 2018, a bus advertisement on game development inspired me to learn coding. After building a multitude of projects - as you can see here on GitHub - I found that tech is what enables me to be the most creative, to make the most stuff.

I'm particularly passionate about building tech solutions to societal challenges, such as [NexLiber](https://nexliber.com) (an edutech platform for developers) and [Manga Layout Analysis](https://github.com/xyntechx/Manga-Layout-Analysis) (a published research project which is an automated deep learning manga analysis system to assist overworked Japanese animators). In the future, I hope to lead the development of human-compatible technologies for public good.

Outside of tech, I love to play volleyball, boulder, and draw manga!
