I am Nyx Iskandar, a teenager passionate about Computer Science and all things STEM! As a programmer, I aim to create fun via the code I write, which is translated into games, web apps, and other interesting projects. In doing so, I hope to teach and inspire those who aspire to pursue STEM in the future.

## Languages & Tools
I can program in:

and I usually use:
- Visual Studio Code/Jupyter Notebook/Spyder/IntelliJ IDEA (for random programs)
- Visual Studio + Unity (for Unity games)
- Android Studio (for apps)

## Interests
I love to:
- program
- draw (I've been drawing my own comic book series since the age of 8)
- play sports (my favorite sport is basketball)

## Achievements
- Top in Cohort (Grades 1 - 9) (as of now)
- IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2020 Foundational Badge
- Bronze Medal in the 2020 Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad
- President of Student Council (2019 - 2020)
- Gold Award in [iCAN 2019](https://www.tisias.org/ican-2019.html)
- 10th place (out of 300+ participants) in the 2019 National Public Speaking Competition
- 2019 STEAM Excellence Pinnacle Award (school-based award)
- 14th place (out of 150+ participants) in the 2018 National Environment Quiz
- Distinction Award in the 2017 ICAS Science by UNSW Global
- and several others I earned before 2017 :)

## Goals
As I pursue my passion in programming, I look forward to learning many more concepts and techniques in the ever-growing field of Computer Science. Currently, I am learning Machine Learning and Quantum Computing because I am extremely intrigued by those fields! Furthermore, I hope to create more games and apps because, in all honesty, I thoroughly enjoy programming and designing as both allow me to express myself creatively in this thought-provoking field. Last but not least, I want to dive into competitive programming as I hope to polish up my problem solving and creative thinking skills. All in all, I aim to learn something new every single day!
