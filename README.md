I'm Nyx Iskandar a.k.a. xyntechx, a 16-year-old indie game and app developer.
As a budding programmer, I aim to create fun via the code I write, which is translated into games, mobile apps, and other cool stuff. Needless to say, life is about experimentation - and having fun while you're at it!

## Goals
As I pursue my passion in programming, I look forward to learning many more concepts and techniques in the ever-growing field of Computer Science.
I hope to create many more games and apps because, in all honesty, I thoroughly enjoy programming and designing as both allow me to express myself creatively in this thought-provoking field. I also do hope to be able to learn more research-based and industrial applications of Computer Science. Hence, I aim to learn Machine Learning soon!
