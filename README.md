> Check out the new (still in-progress) NexLiber [here](https://nexliber-cal.vercel.app/)! I welcome all feedback!

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Nyx (a.k.a. [xyntechx](https://xyntechx.com))

I'm an innovative coder and tech founder passionate about creating for the community. An ardent techie, I've been awarded the **Smart Nation Scholarship** by GovTech Singapore, and am studying at **UC Berkeley** as an Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences (**EECS**) major.

Ever-curious, I'm constantly building projects to learn new technologies and refine my skills in familiar ones. My main ongoing project is [NexLiber](https://nexliber.com/) (I am currently revamping it to bring it to the whole UC Berkeley community and beyond - check out the in-progress platform [here](https://nexliber-cal.vercel.app/)). You can find more of my personal projects [here](https://github.com/xyntechx?tab=repositories) and more of my "professional" projects [here](https://github.com/teamxynlab).

Feel free to check out my [website](https://xyntechx.com) ðŸš€
