Hi there 👋 My name is Nyx (a.k.a. [xyntechx](https://xyntechx.com))

Inspired by sci-fi movies such as Astro Boy and Wall-E, my debut in tech was a result of my immense curiosity and drive to explore the unprecedented. As I grow as an ardent techie, my motivation to build flourishes into one that increasingly includes solving societal challenges, pushing me to create technological solutions to assist people in fields as broad as education (e.g. through [NexLiber](https://nexliber.com)) and as niche as Japanese animation (e.g. through [Manga Layout Analysis](https://github.com/xyntechx/Manga-Layout-Analysis)). Today, I'm primarily building projects in robotics, computer vision, and full stack web dev, and my research interests lie in human-robot cooperation, corrigible AI, and AI safety.
