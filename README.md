# About
I'm Nyx Iskandar a.k.a. xyntechx, a 16-year-old indie game and app developer.
As a budding programmer, I aim to create fun via the code I write, which is translated into games, mobile apps, and other cool stuff. Needless to say, life is about experimentation - and having fun while you're at it!

## Languages & Tools
I can program in:

and I usually use:
- Visual Studio Code/Atom/Jupyter Notebook/Spyder/IntelliJ IDEA (for random programs)
- Visual Studio + Unity (for Unity games)
- Android Studio (for apps)

# My Programming Milestones

## My First Code
During my 8th grade finals, I became intrigued about the world of programming - for no tangible reason! The first language I learnt is Java and I used [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) to learn its syntax.
> I fell in love instantly.

One thing I realised is how similar programming is to math; in both subjects, we are expected to solve novel problems using already-established equations/syntax. The freedom and challenge offered by programming made me addicted to it. Instead of studying, I spent my time coding and trying out different (simple) projects in Codecademy. For those of you who are wondering, don't worry, I still did well for my finals (I came in 1st in my cohort - weird flex but ok).

## Project ARdent
Project ARdent, a personal assistant wearable device tailored for elderly with dementia that incorporates Augmented Reality (AR) and electronics, offers interactive 3-dimensional notification display to animate reminders at their precise times, e.g. doctor appointments, grandchildrenâ€™s birthdays, social events, etc. A smart watch, serving as a placeholder for the AR to be displayed, and glasses as a monitor to view the notifications, are included. Project ARdent helps to tackle dementia by setting up simple, consistent, and accessible notifications, enabling the elderly to lead more independent and fruitful lives.
> Empathy drives innovation

As this project was positively received by our mentors and beneficiaries, my group (consisting of 4 of my schoolmates and myself) decided to submit Project ARdent to iCAN 2019, an international invention innovation competition in Canada. We received, as mentioned above, the **_Gold Medal_** award from the competition, and I'm extremely humbled by this achievement. Without the support and hard work of each and every one who is part of the team, we couldn't have won this international award. Truly, _united we stand, divided we fall_.

> Teamwork makes the dream work

## Black Hole
On November 2019, I decided to make my own game after playing my childhood game, Minecraft! I knew that I wanted to make a simple yet satisfying game as I was inspired by the countless mobile games which I have come across a million times before. Hence, I pulled out my laptop, found out about Unity, drew the designs I needed to draw, and proceeded to put things together. _Volia!_ Black Hole was born.

Without a doubt, the journey wasn't all that easy, especially since this was my first attempt at creating my very own real game from scratch. For starters, I had to learn a new language (C#) to be able to program in Unity. Afterwards, I had to learn the myriads of Unity-only functions so that I could actually program the game. Drawing the designs for the game was also no easy feat. Nonetheless, I sincerely enjoyed the process as it made me appreciate the art of programming and designing more.


# Final Words
As I pursue my passion in programming, I hope to learn many more concepts and techniques in the ever-growing field of Computer Science.
I hope to create many more games and apps because, in all honesty, I thoroughly enjoy programming and designing as both allow me to express myself creatively in this thought-provoking field. I also do hope to be able to learn more research-based and industrial applications of Computer Science. Hence, I aim to learn Machine Learning soon! Who knows, I may be spending my next finals week programming again (oops).
